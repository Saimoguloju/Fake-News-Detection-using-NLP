## About the Project: 
I'm embarking on a project where I'll leverage a CSV dataset containing four columns to develop a sophisticated machine learning model. This model will be designed to effectively classify news articles as either authentic or fabricated. By harnessing the power of data and machine learning algorithms, My aim is to create a robust tool that can accurately discern between real and fake news, thereby contributing to the fight against misinformation.
## Getting started:
1. Select the path of the project
```python
cd path of the project
```
2. Create a Virtual Enviroment
``` python
python -m venv env
source env\Scripts\activate
```
## Installation
1. install dependencies
```python
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
## Objective of the project
The objective of this project is to combat the proliferation of fake news by implementing data-driven strategies for detection. This entails compiling datasets containing various features such as article content, source credibility, publication history, and social media engagement. Through exploratory data analysis (EDA) and feature engineering, we aim to refine data quality and glean insights into the characteristics of fake news. Machine learning models and natural language processing, including classification algorithms, will be developed to accurately identify instances of misinformation. The emphasis lies in interpreting model outputs to understand the underlying factors contributing to the dissemination of fake news, facilitating targeted interventions. Ethical and regulatory considerations will be paramount throughout the project. Project findings will be documented in comprehensive reports for stakeholders, aiming to combat misinformation and promote information integrity through data-driven decision-making.
