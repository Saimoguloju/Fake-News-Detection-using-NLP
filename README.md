## About the Project: 
I'm embarking on a project where I'll leverage a CSV dataset containing four columns to develop a sophisticated machine learning model. This model will be designed to effectively classify news articles as either authentic or fabricated. By harnessing the power of data and machine learning algorithms, My aim is to create a robust tool that can accurately discern between real and fake news, thereby contributing to the fight against misinformation.
## Getting started:
1. Select the path of the project

```
2. Create a Virtual Enviroment
``` python
python -m venv env
source env\Scripts\activate
```
## Installation
1. install dependencies
```python
pip install -r requirements.txt
